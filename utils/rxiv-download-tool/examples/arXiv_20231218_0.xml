 <dc:title>Inflection system of a language as a complex network</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We investigate inflection structure of a synthetic language using Latin as an
example. We construct a bipartite graph in which one group of vertices
correspond to dictionary headwords and the other group to inflected forms
encountered in a given text. Each inflected form is connected to its
corresponding headword, which in some cases in non-unique. The resulting sparse
graph decomposes into a large number of connected components, to be called word
groups. We then show how the concept of the word group can be used to construct
coverage curves of selected Latin texts. We also investigate a version of the
inflection graph in which all theoretically possible inflected forms are
included. Distribution of sizes of connected components of this graphs
resembles cluster distribution in a lattice percolation near the critical
point.

 <dc:title>On the calibration of neural networks for histological slide-level

 <dc:description>  Deep Neural Networks have shown promising classification performance when
predicting certain biomarkers from Whole Slide Images in digital pathology.
However, the calibration of the networks' output probabilities is often not
evaluated. Communicating uncertainty by providing reliable confidence scores is
of high relevance in the medical context. In this work, we compare three neural
network architectures that combine feature representations on patch-level to a
slide-level prediction with respect to their classification performance and
evaluate their calibration. As slide-level classification task, we choose the
prediction of Microsatellite Instability from Colorectal Cancer tissue
sections. We observe that Transformers lead to good results in terms of
classification performance and calibration. When evaluating the classification
performance on a separate dataset, we observe that Transformers generalize
best. The investigation of reliability diagrams provides additional insights to
the Expected Calibration Error metric and we observe that especially
Transformers push the output probabilities to extreme values, which results in
overconfident predictions.

 <dc:title>RIS-Enabled NLoS Near-Field Joint Position and Velocity Estimation under

 <dc:description>  In the context of single-base station (BS) non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
single-epoch localization with the aid of a reflective reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS), this paper introduces a novel three-step algorithm
that jointly estimates the position and velocity of a mobile user equipment
(UE), while compensating for the Doppler effects observed in near-field (NF) at
the RIS elements over the short transmission duration of a sequence of downlink
(DL) pilot symbols. First, a low-complexity initialization procedure is
proposed, relying in part on far-field (FF) approximation and a static user
assumption. Then, an alternating optimization procedure is designed to
iteratively refine the velocity and position estimates, as well as the channel
gain. The refinement routines leverage small angle approximations and the
linearization of the RIS response, accounting for both NF and mobility effects.
We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm through extensive
simulations under diverse operating conditions with regard to signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), UE mobility, uncontrolled multipath and RIS-UE distance. Our
results reveal remarkable performance improvements over the state-of-the-art
(SoTA) mobility-agnostic benchmark algorithm, while indicating convergence of
the proposed algorithm to respective theoretical bounds on position and
velocity estimation.
