We construct a bipartite graph in which one group of vertices\ncorrespond to dictionary headwords and the other group to inflected forms\nencountered in a given text. Each inflected form is connected to its\ncorresponding headword, which in some cases in non-unique. The resulting sparse\ngraph decomposes into a large number of connected components, to be called word\ngroups. We then show how the concept of the word group can be used to construct\ncoverage curves of selected Latin texts. We also investigate a version of the\ninflection graph in which all theoretically possible inflected forms are\nincluded. Distribution of sizes of connected components of this graphs\nresembles cluster distribution in a lattice percolation near the critical\npoint.",

Kocha\\'nski gave only a partial explanation of the\nalgorithm used to produce these approximations, while promising to publish\ndetails at a later time, which has never happened.

                "In the context of single-base station (BS) non-line-of-sight (NLoS)\nsingle-epoch localization with the aid of a reflective reconfigurable\nintelligent surface (RIS), this paper introduces a novel three-step algorithm\nthat jointly estimates the position and velocity of a mobile user equipment\n(UE), while compensating for the Doppler effects observed in near-field (NF) at\nthe RIS elements over the short transmission duration of a sequence of downlink\n(DL) pilot symbols. First, a low-complexity initialization procedure is\nproposed, relying in part on far-field (FF) approximation and a static user\nassumption. Then, an alternating optimization procedure is designed to\niteratively refine the velocity and position estimates, as well as the channel\ngain. The refinement routines leverage small angle approximations and the\nlinearization of the RIS response, accounting for both NF and mobility effects.\nWe evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm through extensive\nsimulations under diverse operating conditions with regard to signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR), UE mobility, uncontrolled multipath and RIS-UE distance. Our\nresults reveal remarkable performance improvements over the state-of-the-art\n(SoTA) mobility-agnostic benchmark algorithm, while indicating convergence of\nthe proposed algorithm to respective theoretical bounds on position and\nvelocity estimation.",
